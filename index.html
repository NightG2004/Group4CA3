            <h2>What is Renewable Energy?</h2>
            <p>Renewable energy refers to energy that is generated from natural resources that are replenished on a
                human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, geothermal heat, and more. These sources
                are essential for reducing the impact of climate change.</p>
            <p>The importance of renewable energy lies in its ability to reduce carbon emissions, increase energy
                security, and provide sustainable energy sources for future generations.</p>

            <h2>Why is renewable energy important?</h1>
                <p>Renewable energy, or clean energy, is vital to prevent the depletion of limited natural resources in
                    the
                    face of a growing human population and with <a

                        AI.</a> Additionally, the use of renewable energy will help to combat global warming and its
                    detrimental effects on humans and other species on our planet.</p>

                <p><b>Fun Facts : </b> As of <time>December 24 </time>, it is said that the total amount of solar energy
                    incident on Earth far surpasses that which is required of the world, even in predictions of future
                    needs. If harnessed efficiently, it may be enough to meet all future energy demands.</p>
