            <p>Biofuel is a renewable energy source made from <b>biomass</b> â€” organic materials like plants,
                agricultural waste, and algae. Unlike fossil fuels, biofuels are produced relatively quickly and can be
                replenished. <br>The most common types of biofuels are:</p>
            <ol class="text-left">
                <li><b>Ethanol</b> - A type of alcohol made from fermenting crops like corn or sugarcane. It&apos;s
                    often blended with gasoline to reduce emissions.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Biodiesel</b> - Made from vegetable oils, animal fats, or recycled cooking grease. It can be used
                    in diesel engines.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Biogas</b> - Produced through the breakdown of organic matter (like food waste or manure) in the
                    absence of oxygen, commonly used for generating electricity or heating.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>How Biofuels Work</h2>
            <p>Biofuels are derived from organic materials such as plant and animal waste. They can be used to replace
                gasoline, diesel, and other fossil fuels in vehicles and power plants.</p>
            <p>Biofuels are a key component of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
