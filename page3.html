            <p>Wind energy is a form of renewable energy generated by converting wind flow into electricity using wind
                turbines. Itâ€™s one of the fastest-growing sources of energy globally due to its potential to reduce
                carbon emissions and reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

            <h2>How Wind Energy Works</h2>
            <p>Wind turbines capture the kinetic energy of wind and convert it into electricity. The wind turns the
                blades of the turbine, which spins a generator to produce electrical power.</p>
            <p>Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing sources of renewable energy, especially in regions with strong
                winds.</p>

                    <h3 class="d-block bg-primary text-white m-0">Advantages</h3>
                    <div>
                        <b>Job stability : </b> The development of wind energy creates numerous
                        long-term and lucrative jobs in industries like component production, installation and
                        construction, upkeep and operations, legal and advertising services and more.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>Independence from water : </b> Wind turbines do not rely on
                        water to operate.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>Versatility : </b>Wind energy is suitable for multiple environments, such
                        as in agricultural or working landscapes. They can be installed in distant and rural areas
                        too.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>Conservative land usage : </b>Despite the immense height of
                        windmills, they do not take up as much space compared to solar systems.

                    <h3 class="d-block bg-primary text-white m-0">Disadvantages</h3>
                    <div>
                        <span id="dis5"><b>Noise pollution : </b>The turbines of a windmill can produce loud noise and
                            create a disturbance to humans living nearby, even driving the prices of the nearby land and
                            properties down.</span>

                    <div>
                        <span id="dis6"><b>Visually unappealing : </b> Due to their vertical massiveness, windmills can
                            ruin the aesthetics of a landscape. The flickering shadows cast during the rotation of the
                            blades are also disturbing to some.</span>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <span id="dis7"><b>Durability concerns : </b>Wind turbines must be built to survive high wind
                            speeds while being able to generate energy with relatively weak winds.</span>
                    </div>

                            with
                            wind turbines. Consideration to the surrounding animals must be had during the construction
                            of wind systems.</span>
