            <p>Solar energy is energy harnessed from sunlight using technologies like <abbr
                    title="photovoltaic cells"><b>solar panels</b></abbr> and <b>solar thermal systems</b>. Itâ€™s a
                clean, renewable energy source that plays a critical role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
                combating climate change.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>How Solar Energy Works</h2>
            <p>Solar panels convert sunlight into electricity through photovoltaic cells. The energy from the sun is
                absorbed by the panels, which then generate electrical current.</p>
            <p>Solar energy is one of the most widely adopted renewable energy technologies due to its ability to
                generate electricity from a free, abundant resource.</p>

                    <div class="mt-2"><b>Energy Independence : </b>As most parts of the Earth receive
                        sunlight, every country has the potential to harness solar energy of its own.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>Low Environmental Impact : </b>Solar Panel do not
                        produce noise,
                        unlike windmills. They do not disturb the quality of life of people and animals living
                        in the
                        vicinity.</p>

                        <b>Sustainability : </b>The Sun will exist until the end of
                        civilisation.
                        Without it, humans would likely go extinct. Therefore, its energy can be harnessed as
                        long as we
                        are still around.
                    </div>
                    <div class="mb-2"><b>Minimal upkeep : </b>PV panels generally require little
                        maintenance
                        compared to other sources of energy, especially as there are no moving parts. This
                        reduces the
                        costs required to keep them operating.</div>

                    <div>
                        <b>Limited uptime : </b>As is obvious, electricity can only be generated from
                        solar
                        energy while the Sun is visible in the sky. This means that solar panels are only
                        effective
                        during the day and under clear weather, which means that the supply is not completely
                        reliable.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>Land use : </b>The installation of large-scale solar panel projects requires
                        a
                        similarly large amount of land, which could be infeasible for countries or cities with
                        limited
                        land space.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>Hazardous materials : </b>Though perhaps not as significant as that of other
                        energy
                        sources, solar technology does harbour many toxic materials. Therefore, one must
                        exercise
                        caution when disposing the waste generated from their use.
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>Significant initial cost : </b>While the investment necessary to maintain
                        solar
                        panels pales in comparison to that required of windmills, procuring a solar system
                        necessitates
                        a considerable sum of money for the initial expenditure.
